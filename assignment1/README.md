Make changes to index.html so that each row has:
- 4 cards in large screen
- 3 cards in medium screen
- 2 cards in small screen
- 1 card in extra small screen

Content within each card should be organized as discussed in class:
- Large screen should have image right aligned, while name and role are in 2 different lines
- Medium screen should have image in one row and both name and role in another row
- Both small and extra small screens should have image, name and role each in a different row.
